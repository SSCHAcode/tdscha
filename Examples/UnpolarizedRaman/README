The scripts in this folder can be used to compute the Unpolarized Raman scattering

run.py generates the input files to run the Lanczos algorithm in a cluster.

Once the calculation is finished, the final Green function can be computed (taking into consideration all the necessary combinations of the polarization modes) using the save_gf.py script.
